      <p>
        Hi there! My name is Cristian Castillo and I am an aspiring web developer. I live in San Antonio, Texas with my cat, Boomer. He is my favorite thing in this world.
         I have learned a lot from these last few months of this bootcamp and i think it shows. 
        JavaScript, MySQL, React, and MongoDB are just a few of the technologies I've gotten familiar with.
        I am a very hard working and motivated person that is quick to adapt in any situation. I always try to have a positive attitude with everyone.

      </p>
